# SMIF Portfolio Overview

This Jupyter notebook generates a portfolio overview for a Student Managed Investment Fund (SMIF), which is set up for educational purposes and works with a virtual portfolio (no money, just numbers).

The basic functionality is quite straightforward. The SMIF portfolio manager describes and updates the composition of the portfolio in a code cell. When the code is executed, it determines (1) the current prices based on data from Yahoo Finance, (2) the current exchange rates based on data from the European Central Bank, (3) the value and relative weight of each stock in the portfolio, (4) the total value of the portfolio. These outputs are provided in tabular form. In addition, (5) the relative weight of each stock is shown in a pie chart.

For further details, please, refer to the introduction section of the [notebook](https://github.com/felicia-sch/SMIFportfolio/blob/main/portfolio.ipynb).
